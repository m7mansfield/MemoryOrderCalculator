# MemoryOrderCalculator
This is a small C++ program that takes the decimal memory location
of a piece of data of a defined generic size unit for a 2D array
and calculates what address a given matrix coordinate would be in
memory for row-major and column-major storage orders.

(It was meant simply as a programing excercise in understanding row vs. column major order,
and does not produce actual useful information.)
